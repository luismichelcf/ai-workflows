// How the engine talks to the coding CLIs: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, Muse.
//
// Three rules shape everything here, each one learned from a real incident:
//
//   1. Exit code 0 is not success. A CLI can exit cleanly having done nothing, having hit a
//      quota, or having been cut off mid-stream. Success is read from its own structured
//      output: a terminal event, a result record, a status field.
//   2. A timeout is not a quota. Treating an unrecognised failure as "out of quota" would
//      silently hand the work to another model. Anything not clearly identified is `failed`
//      or `incomplete`, and a person looks at it.
//   3. The prompt is data, never shell. It travels on stdin or as one argument, and no
//      command line is ever built by concatenating strings.
//
// Everything in this file is pure: building an invocation and reading an output. Actually
// spawning the process belongs to the runner, so these rules can be tested without calling
// a paid model.
